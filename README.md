# CDEF
Here is a resource library of low-light image enhancement papers based on cell vibration theory. It runs very fast. The encryption code and demo that can be used will be published after the paper is accepted.

## Images displayed in paper

21 low light images displayed in the paper can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/uIrMJv36RZVn) or [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nNWskL1NKZSmK44XaSfqCg)(提取码：tqn3) (size = 42.41MB). 


## Modified version of HDR dataset

250 pairs of images in HDR dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/yymaUrmuiMny) or [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1v8YoVVwJE5qLx_JldNAaXg)(提取码：q6ak) (size = 352MB).

The zip file contains two folders, the 'lowlight' folder and the 'Refimg' folder.

'lowlight' folder contains 250 images under low light.

'Refimg' folder contains 250 images under normal light.

Note: 

1.Please do not change the serial number of the images. They correspond to each other. e.g.  'HDRR(1).PNG' is the reference image under normal illumination of 'HDRL(1).PNG'.
