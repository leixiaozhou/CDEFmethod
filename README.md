# Low-light Image Enhancement Using the Cell Vibration Model
# CDEF：Cell-Dual region-Energy-Fusion
Here is a resource library of low-light image enhancement papers based on the cell vibration theory. It runs very fast. Specifically: Using MATLAB platform, 4500W pixel color image only needs 1.8s running time. The paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (IEEE TMM) on May 12, 2022. The encryption code and demo are now available for download.

## Images displayed in paper

20 images displayed in the paper can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=qymAJzayuei2)（访问码：mgj4）or [pCloud URL](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZCNfHVZ4MYNMM5C8Buy29FaHGdDJh6tSYzV) (size = 13.51MB). 


## Modified version of HDR dataset

250 pairs of images in HDR dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=NZ7ZZbjeuAVz) or [pCloud URL](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZ2NfHVZChgPglepTRLgNkuMHbULgB9Ja2bV) (size = 352MB).

The zip file contains two folders, the 'lowlight' folder and the 'Refimg' folder.

'lowlight' folder contains 250 images under low light.

'Refimg' folder contains 250 images under normal light.

Note: 

1.Please do not change the serial number of the images. They correspond to each other. e.g.  'HDRR(1).PNG' is the reference image under normal illumination of 'HDRL(1).PNG'.
