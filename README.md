# Low-light Image Enhancement Using the Cell Vibration Model
# CDEF
Here is a resource library of low-light image enhancement papers based on cell vibration theory. It runs very fast. The encryption code and demo that can be used will be published after the paper is accepted.

## Images displayed in paper

14 images displayed in the paper can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=EbE73mRJbeua)(size = 11.8MB). 


## Modified version of HDR dataset

250 pairs of images in HDR dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=NZ7ZZbjeuAVz) (size = 352MB).

The zip file contains two folders, the 'lowlight' folder and the 'Refimg' folder.

'lowlight' folder contains 250 images under low light.

'Refimg' folder contains 250 images under normal light.

Note: 

1.Please do not change the serial number of the images. They correspond to each other. e.g.  'HDRR(1).PNG' is the reference image under normal illumination of 'HDRL(1).PNG'.
