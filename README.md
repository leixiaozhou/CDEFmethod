# CVE-G-Dataset
论文中的使用的数据集分别是LIME,SIDD,HDR以及Exdark,图像数量分别是10,70,292,600。

## LIME dataset

10 images in LIME dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/AJRfYvUFBV3e) (size = 8.66MB).

## SIDD dataset

70 images in SIDD dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/IbmIZrzArAzm) (size = 8.12MB). This is the downsampling version of the original SIDD data. For reducing the calculation time, the statistical index experiment uses this.

Note:

1.70 images data can be found in SIDD-Small Dataset(Subset Download: [sRGB images only (~6 GB)](https://competitions.codalab.org/my/datasets/download/a26784fe-cf33-48c2-b61f-94b299dbc0f2) ). 'SIDD-Small Dataset' is a small version of SIDD Dataset. Almost all images with the 'L' suffix in the file name are selected as experimental images. For example: '0001_001_S6_00100_00060_3200_L'.

## HDR dataset

292 pairs of images in HDR dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/yymaUrmuiMny) (size = 398.16MB).

The zip file contains two folders, the 'lowlight' folder and the 'Refimg' folder.

'lowlight' folder contains 292 images under low light.

'Refimg' folder contains 292 images under normal light.

Note: 

1.Please do not change the serial number of the images. They correspond to each other. e.g.  'HDRR(1).PNG' is the reference image under normal image of 'HDRL(1).PNG'.

2.The complete HDR dataset includes 1811 images, from which we randomly selected 494 color images.

## ExDark dataset

600 images in ExDark dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/jAbQveiqeEZb) (size = 110.70MB).

Note: 

1.The complete ExDark dataset includes 7363 images, from which we randomly selected 600 color images.
